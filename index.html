                        <p>We started our Tawas City Michigan location with the idea of delivering more to our customers. Our entire staff has a passion for bringing happiness to the people that we serve. I am always pushing our Phone Daddies to deliver more! Phone Daddies is much more than just a phone repair business, we consider ourselves to be artists in our trade. </p>
                        <p>I am passionate about phones, with a hobby of refurbishing furniture, it eventually lead me to an interest in electronic refurbishing too! With the same close attention to detail and the experience that I have had working on many models of phones throughout the years, I am was able to pass my knowledge down to other Tawas City phone experts. </p>
                        <p>We are so pleased wherever we are able to present someone with a brand-new phone. We love the experience of being able to reunite people with the devices that they depend on and to help regular people to improve on their smartphone experience. </p>
